#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! `rusty_rtos_kernel-core` — the pure heart of `rusty_rtos_kernel`.
//!
//! Rules this crate lives by (from the Kairos mission plan):
//!
//! 1. `no_std` by default; `alloc` is a feature, never an assumption.
//! 2. No CPU, no registers, no allocator, no operating system. Ports and
//!    backends are separate WRAP crates.
//! 3. Every type that crosses to another Kairos package comes from
//!    `rusty_rtos_core`, so packages compose without conversions.
//! 4. Handles are indices, never pointers; nothing on a hot path allocates.
//! 5. `forbid(unsafe)`. The C kernel's trace is the oracle; the scalar path
//!    is the oracle; any faster path is gated identical against it.
